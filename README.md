# Nexora AI

Nexora AI is an AI-powered Web3 intelligence platform that makes token discovery faster, smarter, and more transparent.

It brings together community voting, market data, token activity, and on-chain information to generate meaningful insights about emerging tokens. Rather than leaving users to piece together fragmented data by hand, Nexora AI turns complex blockchain and market signals into clear token summaries, community sentiment, trend analysis, and intelligent discovery recommendations.

The platform helps users surface emerging projects, understand community activity, compare token momentum, and make more informed decisions through an intuitive, AI-assisted experience. AI provides analysis and context; users stay fully in control of their wallet actions, votes, purchases, and transactions.

Under the hood, the project is a single repository with three parts that run independently:

- A **React frontend** for browsing, voting, and viewing token analysis.
- An **Express backend** that serves listing data and the AI analysis API.
- A set of **Solidity contracts** (Hardhat) for on-chain credits, tiers, and voting.

## Architecture

```
Browser (React 17)
      │  REST
      ▼
Express API ──► AI analysis service ──► OpenAI-compatible provider
      │                 │
      │                 └─► in-memory cache + insight index
      ▼
Firebase Realtime Database (token catalog)

Wallet (MetaMask / Phantom / Rabby) ──► Smart contracts (credits, tiers, voting)
```

The frontend talks to two data sources: the Express API for AI insights and server-side data, and the blockchain directly (via ethers.js) for wallet actions. Token catalog data lives in Firebase Realtime Database.

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React 17, React Router v6, SCSS, Material-UI |
| Backend | Express.js, Firebase Realtime Database |
| AI | OpenAI-compatible provider, deterministic caching |
| Blockchain | Solidity 0.8.20, Hardhat, OpenZeppelin, ethers.js v5 |
| Wallets | MetaMask, Phantom, Rabby |
| Networks | Ethereum, BSC (EVM); Solana (configurable) |

## Getting started

### Install
```sh
npm install
```

### Configure
Copy the example environment file and fill in your values:
```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Two groups of variables matter:

- **Backend / AI** (no `REACT_APP_` prefix): `AI_PROVIDER`, `OPENAI_KEY`, `OPENAI_MODEL`, `AI_TIMEOUT_MS`, `AI_CACHE_TTL_MS`, `AI_RATE_LIMIT_TOKEN`.
- **Firebase** (`REACT_APP_FIREBASE_*`): project config from the Firebase console, with Realtime Database enabled.

Contract addresses and fee settings live in `src/helpers/configurations/index.js`.

### Run the frontend
```sh
npm start
```
Starts the React dev server at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Run the backend
```sh
npm run server
```
Starts the Express API on port `8080` (override with `PORT`). The two servers run independently; start both in separate terminals for the full experience.

---

## Backend API

The Express app mounts each route group defensively — a group that fails to load is skipped and logged rather than crashing the server.

| Method | Route | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/health` | Liveness check. |
| GET | `/tokens/list` | List tokens. |
| POST | `/tokens/add` | Add a token. |
| POST | `/tokens/del` | Remove a token. |
| GET | `/ai/insights` | Recent cached insight summaries. |
| GET | `/ai/metrics` | AI service metrics. |
| POST | `/ai/discover` | Run a discovery query over listings. |
| GET/POST | `/ai/token/:id` | Analyze a single token. |

---

## Smart contracts

### Compile and test
```sh
npm run compile
npm run test:contracts
```

### Build and sync ABIs to the frontend
```sh
npm run build:contracts
```
Compiles contracts and copies ABIs to `src/helpers/abis/`.

### Deploy
```sh
npm run deploy:local     # local Hardhat network
npm run deploy:sepolia   # Sepolia testnet
npm run deploy:mainnet   # Ethereum mainnet
```
Deployment records are written to `deployments/<network>.json`. Fill in network URLs and accounts in `hardhat.config.js` before deploying to a public network.

### Contract overview
- **NexoraAI.sol** — credit system: `buyCredits()`, `spendCredits(amount, reason)`, `buyRubyTier()`, `buyDiamondTier()`, `withdraw()`, `pause()` / `unpause()`.
- **VotingManager.sol** — on-chain voting: `vote(coinId)`, `votesRemainingToday(address)`, `getVotes(coinId)`, with fees forwarded to the treasury on each vote.

Both contracts use OpenZeppelin's `Ownable`, `ReentrancyGuard`, and `Pausable`.
